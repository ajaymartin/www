								Integrated Smart Home, Jun ‘03
								<br>
								Advisor: Dr. CN Ravikumar, Prof. and Chair, Dept. of Computer Science, SJCE
								<br>
								Summary: The application, based on Home Networking, allows people
								<br>
								to control various electrical appliances of the house from either
								<br>
								the local computer, Internet or a mobile phone in a cost efficient
								<br>
								manner. The concept and project was selected by the department for
								<br>
								technology transfer to SEED, Software Technology Park of India,
								<br>
								SJCE-STEP (Software Technology Entrepreneur Park) for further development
								<br>
								and manufacturing.<br>
								<br>
								File Sharing Application on Peer to Peer Networks Jun '02<br>
								Summary: The application allows users to share any type of file –
								<br>
								music, docs, source etc. over the Internet. This was a centralized
								<br>
								p2p network, with the nodes on Linux and a gtk ui.<br>
								Project was selected and awarded a prize for the finals of ‘Impetus 2002’,
								<br>
								a Software Design Contest, conducted by IEEE, UVCE (Univ. of Visveswariah
								<br>
								College of Engineering) Chapter.
								<br>
								<br>
								Implementation of NAPT(Network Address Port Translator) Dec '02<br>
								The NAT was over a TCP/IP network. A Linux2.4.2 acted as the NAT box
								<br>
								and completely hid a 10-node IPv4 LAN from the Internet.
								<br>
								<br>
								Other projects include A Full Screen Text Editor [Jun 01], an Inventory
								<br>
								Management System for an Automobile Industry [Jun 02],
								<br>
								a Web based Message Board using CGI [Dec 02], and a Game of Snooker on JAVA[Dec 
								02]<br>

								<br>
								Cache Management: session independent caching of meta data
								<br>
								Summary: developed a framework to enable a cache management system
								<br>
								that allowed the Talisma Win32 Client to have access to the property
								<br>
								meta data. Persistence was across sessions, Data integrity, security,
								<br>
								synchronization of state and speed were primary considerations of design.<br>
								[details at http://www.geocities.com/ajaymartin/resume/t_cmgr.html]<br>
								<br>
								<STRONG>Wisteron Framework:
									<br>
								</STRONG>Summary: Developed a framework to harness the idle computing power of 
								the
								<br>
								machines in any network and use them to run configurable jobs. The central
								<br>
								server would ensure to run these jobs to get a specified throughput.
								<br>
								This was implemented for the smoke tests that were done on the idle
								<br>
								machines available in the Talisma LAN.<br>
								[details at http://www.geocities.com/ajaymartin/resume/t_wisteron.html]<br>
								<br>
								<STRONG>SQL to Oracle Porting: </STRONG>
								<br>
								Summary: Developed a prototype and investigated into porting the database
								<br>
								layer of Talisma®, a three tiered software that uses MS SQL, to Oracle.
								<br>
								[details at http://www.geocities.com/ajaymartin/resume/t_oport.html]<br>
								<br>
								<STRONG>Blogging Integration with Talisma®:
									<br>
								</STRONG>Summary: Envisioned the idea and showed how Talisma could leverage RDF 
								on
								<br>
								the Internet (and specifically blogging) as a media in the CRM space. The
								<br>
								Talisma Middle Tier was made to act both as a RSS/ATOM reader as well as to
								<br>
								house the blog server that any CSA could use.<br>
								<br>
								<STRONG>XML Mapper: </STRONG>
								<br>
								Summary: xml2xml is a tool that allows mapping any xml from one schema to
								<br>
								another given a mapping definition. I manage the project which is housed at
								<br>
								http://sourceforge.net/projects/xml2xml<br>
								<br>
								<STRONG>SMTP integration:<br>
								</STRONG>Summary: Integrated incoming and outgoing mails to and from the 
								application
								<br>
								framework and the underlying jxta implementation of the p2p network.
