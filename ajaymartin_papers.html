							<i>Computing Optimal Subsets</i> - Ronen Brafman, Ajay Mani, Shimony Eyal and Max Binshtok ; Submitted to American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2007 (submitted Jan 2007; send me an email for paper)</a>
							<blockquote class = "abstract">
								Various tasks in decision making and decision support require
								selecting a preferred subset of items from a given set of feasible
								items. Recent work in this area considered methods for
								specifying such preferences based on the attribute values of
								individual elements within the set. Of these, the approach
								of (Brafman et al. 2006) appears to be the most general. In
								this paper, we consider the problem of computing an optimal
								subset given such a specification. The problem is shown to
								be NP-hard in the general case, necessitating heuristic search
								methods. We consider two algorithm classes for this problem:
								direct set construction, and implicit enumeration as solutions
								to appropriate CSPs. New algorithms are presented in each
								class and compared empirically against previous results.<br>

							<i>TINX – A Tiny Index Design for Flash Memory on Wireless Sensor Devices </i>- Ajay Mani, Manjunath BR, Philip Levis; Oct 2006, In the proceedings of ACM Sensys, 2006 (Poster paper)</a>
							</li>
							<blockquote class="abstract">
								Flash memory is a cheap, viable storage alternative for
								the low power, energy constrained sensor nodes. It is still
								not clear however, what storage abstractions are best suited
								to Sensornet applications.
								The peculiar read, write and erase characteristics of flash
								memory, imply that index data structures and other
								storage management techniques developed for disks, which
								often depend on in-place modification, may not be
								appropriate for flash. This motivates us to explore
								sophisticated data structures and algorithms that work around
								the constraints and limitations of flash memory to provide an
								efficient indexing mechanism.
								We propose a new method of indexing data onto flash memory 
								that supports value-based range queries, time-based range 
								queries, hybrid queries
								(combination of value-based and time-based range queries
								with && and || operators) and aggregation queries (like
								COUNT, MIN, MAX and AVERAGE). The indexing scheme
								also maximizes wear-leveling, minimizes erases and
								writes, minimizes RAM structures and maintains the index
								and data on flash to facilitate easy block reclamation.

							<blockquote class = "abstract">
								We present MStore, an expansion board for telos and mica
								family nodes that provides a non volatile memory hierarchy.
								MStore has four memory chips: a 32KB FRAM, an 8MB
								NOR flash, a 16MB NOR flash, and a 256MB NAND flash,
								which can be expanded to 8GB if needed. All chips provide
								an SPI bus interface to the node processor. MStore also
								includes a Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD),
								whose primary purpose is to be an SPI to parallel interface
								for the NAND chip. The CPLD can also be used to offload
								complex data processing.
								Using TinyOS TEP-compliant drivers, we measure the
								current draw and latencies of read, write, and erase operations
								of different sizes on each of the storage chips. Through
								this quantitative evaluation, we show that MStore’s manylevel
								hierarchy and simple design provide an open and flexible
								platform for sensor network storage research and experimentation.

							Layered Virtual Binary Search Trees For Efficient Information Access in Self Organizing Decentralized P2P Networks - Ajay M, Manjunath BR; Nov 2004</a>
							</li>
							<blockquote class="abstract">
								In this paper we introduce layered
								virtual binary tree structure, a scalable access
								structure, specifically designed for Peer-
								To-Peer information systems.
								This tree structured ‘Grids’ are
								constructed and maintained by using
								algorithms based on local interactions, provide
								reliable data access, and scale gracefully both
								in storage and communication cost.
								We provide a decentralized, scalable
								information access structure and provide a
								way to improve the highly chaotic and
								inefficient Gnutella infrastructure with advanced
								virtual tree topics.
								We show a way to build a
								binary tree network of peers, without having any
								central authority or global knowledge. The grid
								(network) construction takes place using largely
								local interactions.
								With the layered binary tree grid in
								place, searches for information or resources
								takes place with the minimum number of
								messages sent into the network, thus having the
								best utilization of the bandwidth.
